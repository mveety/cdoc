cdoc -- like godoc but worse and for c

Synopsis:
    cdoc allows you to embed documentation into C files and extract the
    docs out of the file, search for docs in a file, and search for
    functions in a file.

Usage: cdoc [-h] [-S [-t n]] [-s search term] [-f output] [files...]
    -s search term
        search for a function definition and print the documentation
    -f output file
        pipe the output to a file
    -h
        print this message
    -S
        prefer spaces over tabs
    -t n
        use n spaces for tabulation (with -S)

Problems:
    * The parser is pretty ad-hoc and could be significantly improved
    * The formatting of generated documentation is pretty limited and
        could be significantly improved by (possibly) having cdoc do
        the tabulations itself instead of using \t and the terminal.
        This would also enforce some standardized tab size.
    * Everything is really vulnerable to buffer overflows.
    * It's pretty fragile.
    * Lex kinda sucks.
    * It's pretty quick and dirty. Could use some refactoring I think.

Contributing:
	Submit patches by getting in touch or via bitbucket. Be sure not to
	include config.mk if you've made any changes to it. I suggest adding
	these lines to you .hg/hgrc:
		[defaults]
		commit = -X config.mk
		status = -X config.mk
		diff = -X config.mk

Bugs:
    yes.
